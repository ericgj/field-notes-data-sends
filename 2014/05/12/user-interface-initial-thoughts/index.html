      <h1>User interface, initial thoughts</h1>
      <p>So far, it appears that a Task Pad-style interface is preferable to a calendar
interface, but given other office locations use calendars, it&#39;s likely that
both should be possible.</p>
<p>What do I mean by &quot;task pad&quot; vs. &quot;calendar&quot;? In essence, it is a question
of scale and how much detail is shown. The &#39;task pad&#39; shows <em>all</em> fields for
data-send events, but for a limited scale: one day typically, or like Google
&#39;Agenda&#39; view, for as many events fit in a paged container. The calendar
view shows <em>summary</em> fields for each event, but for various larger intervals:
a week, two weeks, a month. The calendar view allows a visual comparison of
workload by day. The task pad view allows quicker editing and more detailed
view of today&#39;s or upcoming workload.</p>
<p>Given the familiarity people have with Google Calendar, my proposal is to have
a similar dashboard, but with the &quot;task pad&quot; view instead of &quot;Agenda&quot;, and
more useful preset date ranges such as <em>Week</em>, <em>2 Weeks</em>, <em>Month</em>, <em>YTD</em>, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, common filters by client, account, &quot;my data sends only&quot;, DM, PM,
office location, status, etc. would be available, that apply across all views.</p>
<p>The interface is very similar for all user groups and roles, although SAs
may have a limited editing capability (e.g. only the ability to change the
status and enter a comment), not sure.</p>
<p>The management interface for PM/DM directors may be different, or may be a
matter of adding some additional summary info to the calendar views, plus the
capability to download the data as CSV, as well as rudimentary visualizations.</p>
