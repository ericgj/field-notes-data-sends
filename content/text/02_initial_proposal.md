title: Initial Proposal

My proposal is to develop a single web-based system to centralize the various 
tools used by PM/DM teams in different offices to keep track of scheduled
data sends.

In addition, this system could by used by SAs to determine when a
particular data send is marked as _ready_ by the PM/DM, eliminating the need 
for the ad-hoc Google Group communication between departments.

The data thus centralized could be easily extracted on a monthly basis, etc.
for management metric reports, either through the same interface or a 
separate interface.

The system should be integrated into company-wide authentication, the easiest
way being authenticating against Google-hosted accounts.

The system could further integrated into existing tools/workflows by:

1. Providing an interface to create _first data sends_ from the PRF system,
where most of the data fields have already been entered;

2. Auto-publishing events to PM/DM personal Google calendars.

I see one of the primary aims of the system to be to _reduce the overall
number of systems_ the PM/DMs have to access on a daily basis, rather than
_adding yet another one to the pile_. Several years ago a PM enumerated to
me 14 systems they have to access on a regular basis. I can't imagine it's
less than that now.
