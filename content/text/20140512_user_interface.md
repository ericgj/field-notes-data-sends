So far, it appears that a Task Pad-style interface is preferable to a calendar
interface, but given other office locations use calendars, it's likely that
both should be possible.

What do I mean by "task pad" vs. "calendar"? In essence, it is a question
of scale and how much detail is shown. The 'task pad' shows _all_ fields for
data-send events, but for a limited scale: one day typically, or like Google
'Agenda' view, for as many events fit in a paged container. The calendar
view shows _summary_ fields for each event, but for various larger intervals:
a week, two weeks, a month. The calendar view allows a visual comparison of
workload by day. The task pad view allows quicker editing and more detailed
view of today's or upcoming workload.

Given the familiarity people have with Google Calendar, my proposal is to have
a similar dashboard, but with the "task pad" view instead of "Agenda", and
more useful preset date ranges such as _Week_, _2 Weeks_, _Month_, _YTD_, etc.

In addition, common filters by client, account, "my data sends only", DM, PM,
office location, status, etc. would be available, that apply across all views.

The interface is very similar for all user groups and roles, although SAs
may have a limited editing capability (e.g. only the ability to change the
status and enter a comment), not sure.

The management interface for PM/DM directors may be different, or may be a
matter of adding some additional summary info to the calendar views, plus the
capability to download the data as CSV, as well as rudimentary visualizations.
