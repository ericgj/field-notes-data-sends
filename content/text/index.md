These are some semi-public notes I'm taking as I develop a web app for
internal use by several departments at my employer.

I am calling them "field notes" for lack of a better term. They are not
intended to be documentation of the application, nor even documentation of the
development process, although that's closer to what I'm aiming for. They will
no doubt develop along with the application. So "field notes" is good for now.

_12 May 2014_ Please note that these notes are quite rough, and will be for
some time, until it's possible to digest the significant points in terms of
design decisions. (They are a little behind where I have actually reached,
so to some extent they have been digested already.) As you will see, there
is currently no code and only the briefest technical discussion, after quite
a bit of background, summary of user requirements, and other preliminary
research materials, which is ongoing. It's not because I haven't begun "real
development": it's to give some flavor of the complexity of the domain,
which in part will shape the technical decisions.

### My motivations for doing this are:

1. Public examples of real application development are badly needed;

2. The techniques and strategies of Freeman/Pryce's _Growing Object Oriented
Software, Guided By Tests_ (GOOS) have not been widely evaluated for and/or
adapted to web application development, despite the widespread influence of
that book;

3. Very little has been written _by developers_ about strategies for working
on teams with non-technical users and other stakeholders;

4. This particular application seems appropriate ("not too big and not too
small"), and I am able to do it without violating any nondisclosure clause;

5. I would very much appreciate feedback, both on the code itself and on
these notes.

I am writing more about my [motivations]({{ url("meta/motivations") }}), but it's really
a lot of words to start there, so shall we just [jump in]( {{ url("summary") }})?
