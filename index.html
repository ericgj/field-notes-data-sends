      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>These are some semi-public notes I&#39;m taking as I develop a web app for
internal use by several departments at my employer.</p>
<p>I am calling them &quot;field notes&quot; for lack of a better term. They are not
intended to be documentation of the application, nor even documentation of the
development process, although that&#39;s closer to what I&#39;m aiming for. They will
no doubt develop along with the application. So &quot;field notes&quot; is good for now.</p>
<p><em>12 May 2014</em> Please note that these notes are quite rough, and will be for
some time, until it&#39;s possible to digest the significant points in terms of
design decisions. (They are a little behind where I have actually reached,
so to some extent they have been digested already.) As you will see, there
is currently no code and only the briefest technical discussion, after quite
a bit of background, summary of user requirements, and other preliminary
research materials, which is ongoing. It&#39;s not because I haven&#39;t begun &quot;real
development&quot;: it&#39;s to give some flavor of the complexity of the domain,
which in part will shape the technical decisions.</p>
<h3 id="my-motivations-for-doing-this-are-">My motivations for doing this are:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Public examples of real application development are badly needed;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The techniques and strategies of Freeman/Pryce&#39;s <em>Growing Object Oriented
Software, Guided By Tests</em> (GOOS) have not been widely evaluated for and/or
adapted to web application development, despite the widespread influence of
that book;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Very little has been written <em>by developers</em> about strategies for working
on teams with non-technical users and other stakeholders;</p>
</li>
<li><p>This particular application seems appropriate (&quot;not too big and not too
small&quot;), and I am able to do it without violating any nondisclosure clause;</p>
</li>
<li><p>I would very much appreciate feedback, both on the code itself and on
these notes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am writing more about my <a href="/meta/motivations">motivations</a>, but it&#39;s really
a lot of words to start there, so shall we just <a href="/summary">jump in</a>?</p>
