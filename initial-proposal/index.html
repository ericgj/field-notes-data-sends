      <h1>Initial Proposal</h1>
      <p>My proposal is to develop a single web-based system to centralize the various 
tools used by PM/DM teams in different offices to keep track of scheduled
data sends.</p>
<p>In addition, this system could by used by SAs to determine when a
particular data send is marked as <em>ready</em> by the PM/DM, eliminating the need 
for the ad-hoc Google Group communication between departments.</p>
<p>The data thus centralized could be easily extracted on a monthly basis, etc.
for management metric reports, either through the same interface or a 
separate interface.</p>
<p>The system should be integrated into company-wide authentication, the easiest
way being authenticating against Google-hosted accounts.</p>
<p>The system could further integrated into existing tools/workflows by:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Providing an interface to create <em>first data sends</em> from the PRF system,
where most of the data fields have already been entered;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Auto-publishing events to PM/DM personal Google calendars.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I see one of the primary aims of the system to be to <em>reduce the overall
number of systems</em> the PM/DMs have to access on a daily basis, rather than
<em>adding yet another one to the pile</em>. Several years ago a PM enumerated to
me 14 systems they have to access on a regular basis. I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s
less than that now.</p>
